# steps-generator
This is a program I wrote that generates instructions based on pre-made sentence structures and word libraries. I made it because it's funny.

## to do
- [x] turn word libraries into separate txt files
- [ ] add more words
- [ ] add more sentence structures
- [x] make code more readable
- [x] make separate "kid friendly" word library (without certain words)
- [x] think of more things to add to readme

## notes for editing words
adverbs must have a space after each entry, "`quickly `" instead of "`quickly`."
nouns must have `a` or `an` in front of them, "`an apple`" instead of "`apple`." This does not apply to words such as "`yourself`," because you don't say "sit on a yourself," you say "sit on yourself."
