# steps-generator
This is a program I wrote that generates instructions based on pre-made sentence structures and word libraries. I made it because it's funny.

## to do
- [x] turn word libraries into separate txt files
- [ ] add more words
- [ ] add more sentence structures
- [x] make code more readable
- [x] make separate "kid friendly" word library (without certain words)
- [ ] think of more things to add to readme
